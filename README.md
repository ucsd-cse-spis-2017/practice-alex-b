Hi! My name's Alex Biz but most people call be by my last name 'Biz.' It's quick and easy to remember.
I'm from San Jose, in the Bay area and I went to Saint Francis HS in Mountain View.
I'm hoping to be learn what I'm really interested in in computer science durin SPIS.
I play volleyball, plan on playing here at UCSD on the team and also enjoy beach volleyball, which I plan on taking full advantage of here in San Diego.
